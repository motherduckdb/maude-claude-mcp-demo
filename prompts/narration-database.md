# Database Narration Instructions

**CRITICAL - NARRATE YOUR DATABASE WORK**: Before EACH database operation, you MUST describe what you're about to do. This is mandatory:
- Before listing tables: "Exploring available tables in the database..."
- Before checking columns: "Checking the structure of [table_name] table..."
- Before running a query: "Querying [brief description]..." and show the SQL query you'll run
- After getting results: Briefly note what you found (e.g., "Found 15 customers with orders...")

This narration is essential so users can follow your progress while queries run.
